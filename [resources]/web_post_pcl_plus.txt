Hello everybody! The community-made mod "Pocket Crystal League +" (Plus) with expanded content has been released!

PCL+ is a standalone, community-made Pocket Crystal League mod/expansion created by Hyperion_21, Tukurai, DarkAnarchist, and 2fast4you98, that adds cards from Generations 3-7.

The mod is still in an early state, so you may experiment some bugs and other issues that may corrupt your save file. Please report any issues to the modding team in the Discord Server!

The save files from Vanilla are completely separate though, so feel free to check it out!
